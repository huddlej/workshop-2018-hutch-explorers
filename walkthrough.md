## NCBI exploration (30 min)

  * Virus variation database search
    * What do you notice about the kinds of viruses that are available?
    * What information is available for each virus?
    * How would you access the underlying sequence for a given virus?
  * Multiple sequence alignment
    * What patterns do you notice in the multiple sequence alignment?
    * What do the “taller letters” in the MSA Viewer display indicate biologically?
  * What patterns do you notice in the phylogeny?
    * Geographic locations of viruses?
    * Dates?
    * Number of viruses in a group?
    * What is the x-axis measuring?
    * What is the y-axis measuring?

## Nextstrain exploration (30 min)

  * Introduction to the tree
    * Hover over tips and branches
    * Click on branches
    * Reset layout
    * Color-by dropdown
    * Nodes are colored but so are branches. What does this mean?
    * What is the x-axis measuring?
    * What is the y-axis measuring?
  * Introduction to the controls
    * Date range slider
    * Color by
    * Layout
    * Branch lengths
    * Branch labels
    * Panel options (full vs grid)
    * Filters
  * Introduction to the map
    * Play/pause
    * Side-by-side with tree using “grid” view
  * Introduction to the genome view
    * Click on bars to color the tree by mutations at a specific site
